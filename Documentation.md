## Dialogue files

### Dialogue Parsing Structure

|**Element**|**Explanation**|
|-----------|---------------|
| `+` * n | Set the line as an element of a special command (The number of `+` represents the layer) **(optional)** |
| `[wait]` / `[w]` | Will wait for the command to end before you can parse the next line. **(optional)** |
| `characterName` | The character that will be displayed on screen. **(optional)** |
| `{as} customName` | Used to set a display name for the character. **(optional)** |
| `action(value -param paramValue)` | Used to set an action that will modify how the elements in the line will be displayed. **(optional)** |
| `"text"` | The dialogue text. Starts and ends with quotes. **(optional)** |
| `command(value -param paramValue)` | Command to execute after the dialogue. **(optional)** |
| `,` | End of the line. **(optional)** |
---

#### Order and conditions

`+` -> `[wait]` -> `characterName` -> `{as} customName` -> `action()` -> `"text"` -> `command()` -> `,`

- `{as} customName` and `action()` cannot be set if there is no `characterName`.

#### Special scenarios

- If you want the dipslay name of the character to be nothing, simply use `""` as the `customName`.
- Setting a dialogue without setting a character will use the previously selected character.
- Actions persist through the lines until a `characterName` is set.

#### Default values

- It won't wait for the command (if there is one) to end before you can parse the next line.
- Character is null.
- layer = 0
- setting a dialogue will replace the previous one

#### Notes

- Empty lines are skipped.
- An empty text `""` is considered a dialogue.
- If you put no text at all, the line will not be considered as a dialogue.
- If line is a dialogue, it will wait for user input. (except if there is a command saying otherwise).
- If line is not a dialogue, it won't wait for user input. (use the `wu()` command to wait for a user input).
- `characterName`, parameters names, tags, `{as}`, `[wait]`, variables, command names and action names are all case insensitive.
- `characterName` must have at least an empty space before the next element, and should not be a number or contains any `(` or `"`.
- If the element layer is too high (no `+` means **layer = 0**), element layer will reduce until it reaches 0.
- `displayName` can have special characters but not a line break.

### Variables

```
{variableName}
```

Variables can be used in `text`, `characterNames`, `customNames`, and parameters.
- Variables can be updated and refer to variables in the code.
- Use `{variable.variable}` to call variables linked to other variables.

#### Predefined variables

|**Variable**|**Description**|
|-------------|---------------|
| `character` | Get the current character |
| `displayname` | Get the current custom name of the character |
---

&nbsp;

### Tags and special characters

Special characters must be used inside quotes.

|**Character**|**Description**|
|-------------|---------------|
| `\"` | Displays `"` |
| `<\>` | Displays `\` |
| `\{` | Displays `{` |
| `\<` | Displays `<` |
---

The parsing system implemented in this engine uses TextMeshPro RichText.

The full list of tags can be find in the Unity TextMeshPro RichText documentation: [https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/manual/RichText.html]

Here are some basic examples:
|**Tag**|**Description**|
|-------------|---------------|
| `<br>` | Break line |
| `<b></b>` | Displays the text inside in **bold** |
| `<i></i>` | Displays the text inside in *italic* |
|`<underline></underline>`| Displays the text inside is underlined |
|`<strikethrough></strikethrough>`| Displays the text inside crossed-out |
| `<font="fontName"></font>` | Displays the text inside in another FONT |
| `<size=x></s>` | Displays the text inside in another SIZE |
| `<color="colorName"></color>` | Displays the text inside in another COLOR |
---

- If `<x=newValue>` is called before the ending `</x>`, it will override the previous value.
- Some characters (Ex: chinese or mathematic symbols, emojis etc.) may not be parsed correctly. You will need to change the font. If the current font can't handle the character it will display `â–¯`.

&nbsp;

### Special character names

|**CharacterName**|**Description**|
|-----------------|---------------|
| `null` | Set no character |

&nbsp;

### Parameters

Parameters can be added inside `actions` and `commands`. There is 2 types of parameters: **optional** and **non-optional**.

- Optionnal parameters are called like this: `-paramName paramValue`.
- Non-optionnal parameters are called without using `-paramName`.

### Actions

| **Parameters**|**Description**|
|---------------|---------------|
| `-b bool` | Displays the text in **bold** or not |
| `-i bool` | Displays the text in *italic* or not |
| `-cr crossed` | Displays the text crossed or not |
| `-c string` | Set the COLOR of the text |
| `-f string` | Set the FONT of the text |
| `-s int` | Set the SIZE of the text |
| `-sp float`/`-speed float` | Displays the text with a different SPEED (if FLOAT == 0, displays the text immediately) |
| `-im bool` | Same as using `-sp 0`, displays the text immediately |
| `-a string` | Displays the text with a different SOUND (Empty string: SOUND = none) |
| `-n string` | Displays a custom name |
---

- All actions have predefined values for the parameters but you can still change them if you want.

| **Action**|**Description**|
|-----------|---------------|
| `talking()` / `talk()` | No predefined parameter |
| `shouting()` / `shout()` | `-b true` , `-s 18` | //TODO

#### Special commands

Special commands are commands that use lines as additional parameters. To set a line as an element of the special command just put a `+` at the start. To stop adding elements to the special commands, you can simply stop adding `+` at the start of the line.

Special commands can be used inside other special commands, in that case add another `+` at the start of the lines that are elements of this special command.

([refer to 1.3.4](#211-conditions)) |

## Glossary

### 1. Paths

#### [1.2.3] *Paths*

### 2. Commands

#### [2.1.1] *Conditions*

you can use: ==,!=,<,<=,>,>=,&,| and {variable}, true, false, null, Number, "string"

#### [2.1.2] *Operations*

+,-,/,*,^,abs,round,+%,-%,%

#### [2.2.3] *Types of choices*

- list (default, displays a vertical list of choices)
- circle (displays a circle of choices)
- bubbles (displays bubbles of choices displayed horizontaly)


#### [2.2.4] *Input types*

text, name (text without special characters and not a Number), number, numberpos, int, intpos, digits (int, max and min are the number of characters (usefull for codes like 0000))

### 3. String parsing

#### [3.1.1] *Lists*

Some parameters may need some lists.
- If you need a list of numbers you just have to separate the numbers inside the string with empty spaces.
- If you need a more complex list (like a string list), you need to separate every element of the list by `\,`.

## Technical notes

### Global

- When deleting or replacing text, code will analyse if the text breaks any `<\>`. If it does it will repair it by adding additional `<\>`.

### Errors handling

All errors give a log warning.

#### Text errors

- `{invalidVariable}` : displays `{invalidVariable}`
- `<invalid` : skip the tag
- no ending `\x>` : displays everything after the `<x` as if there is a closing `\>` at the end
- `< invalid font \>` : if font can't be displayed in italic, bold, crossed, etc. it will display normally
- `<x{invalidValue} text \>` : default character values
- single `\` with no special char after it : displays `\`
- `{` without a closing `}` : displays `{`
